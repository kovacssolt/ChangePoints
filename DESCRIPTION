Description: Includes the 3 functions interval, findcpts, narrowcpts.
    The function interval provides all the structural set of intervals.
    The function findcpts is the core function and finds all changepoints over a given threshold and can then apply a criterion to find an optimal set of changepoints.
    The function narrowcpts prioritizes narrow intervals over larger intervals and outputs the set of changepoints over a certain threshold.

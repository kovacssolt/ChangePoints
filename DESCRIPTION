Description: Includes the 3 functions interval, findcpts, narrowcpts.
    The function interval provides seeded intervals.
    The function findcpts implements seeded binary segmentation with greedy selection. It finds all changepoints over a given threshold greedily and can then apply an information criterion to find an optimal set of changepoints.
    The function narrowcpts implements seeded binary segmentation with narrowest over threshold based selection for a fixed threshold.
